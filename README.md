# Software-Eng-Final

## Project Description

The group project lets development teams work together to create competing products that allowed different clients with disparate needs in terms of business rule processing. 

Students will form a team within the first 2 weeks and complete the project of their choice during the semester. Each group will consist of three roles:

**Role#1**: Front-end Developer, who will work on the front end implementation of the application. She/he/they will design the user interface and create a logical interface. The front-end developer(s) will also obtain actual data to populate the system.

**Role#2**: Back-end Engineer: who will work on the back-end implementation of the overall system. She/he/they are responsible for storing data in the database, retrieving it, and/or serving it up via an API.

**Role#3**: Scrum Master and Tester: who will work on planning the weekly schedule and managing the entire processes in each sprint. She/he/they will also test the implemented functions and give feedback to their teammates in each developing iteration.

## Project Delivery

Each group should deliver:

* A project proposal
* An inception document included requirements analysis, use-case model, risk management plan, iteration plan, software development plan, and glossary.
* An elaboration document included all design, implementation, and execution of test procedures.
* Project management Scrum board (on Monday.com) with the team meeting agenda, task completion status, time, and progress bar.
* Source code on Github with the correct use of revision control (branching, merging, etc.).
